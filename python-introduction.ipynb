OOP concepts include inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction, which help developers create modular, maintainable, and scalable code.\n","\n","In Python, everything is an object, and classes are used to define new types of objects. Classes can have attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that define their behavior. Objects are instances of classes, and they can interact with each other through methods and attributes.\n","\n","## Classes and Objects\n","\n","In Python, a class is defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name. The class body contains attributes and methods that define the behavior of the class. To create an object of a class, we call the class name as if it were a function, which creates a new instance of the class.\n","\n","```python\n","class MyClass:\n","    def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2):\n","        self.attribute1 = attribute1\n","        self.attribute2 = attribute2\n","\n","    def my_method(self):\n","        return self.attribute1 + self.attribute2\n","```\n","\n","## Inheritance\n","\n","In Python, inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.
